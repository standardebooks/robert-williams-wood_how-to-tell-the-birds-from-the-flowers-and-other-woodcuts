				<span>By other Nature books I’m sure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You’ve often been misled,</span>

				<span>You’ve tried a wall‑flower to secure,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>You’ve wondered what the egg‑plants lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And why the chestnut’s burred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if the hop‑vine hops away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It’s perfectly absurd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hence submit for your inspection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This very new and choice collection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of flowers on Storks, and Phlox of birds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With some explanatory words.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not every one is always able</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To recognize a vegetable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For some are guided by tradition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While others use their intuition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even I make no pretense</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of having more than common sense.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indeed these strange homologies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are in most flornithologies,</span>
